Que 1 :
=======

Write a C program that takes an hour in the 24-hour format as input and identifies the time of day as "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening," or "Night." 
Implement this using a series of if statements. Ensure that the program also checks for invalid input, displaying an appropriate message if the entered hour is not within the valid range (0-23). 
Present the program with a suitable title and header for clarity.

Sample input : Enter the hour (24-hour format): 13
Sample output : It's Afternoon.

Que 2 : 
=======

Write a C program to find maximum between three numbers.

Sample input  : int a = 100, b = 200, c = 300
Sample output : 300


==========================================================================================================

Que 3 : 
=======

Write a C program to check whether a number is negative, positive or zero.

Sample input  : int a = 10
Sample output : possitive number

Sample input  : int a = 0
Sample output : zero

Sample input  : int a = -2
Sample output : negative number


==========================================================================================================

Que 4 :
=======

Write a C program to input any character and check whether it is alphabet, digit or special character.


Sample input  : char ch = 'A';
Sample output : Alphabet

Sample input  : char ch = '9';
Sample output : Digit

Sample input  : char ch = '@';
Sample output : Special character

==========================================================================================================

Que 5 :
=======

Write a C program to input all sides of a triangle and check whether triangle is valid or not.
 
          Validity Check:
          The sum of side1 and side2 must be greater than side3.
          The sum of side1 and side3 must be greater than side2.
          The sum of side2 and side3 must be greater than side1.
          If all three conditions are true, the program prints "The triangle is valid."
          If any of the conditions are false, the program prints "The triangle is not valid."

Sample input  : Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:
                Side 1: 3
                Side 2: 4
                Side 3: 5

Sample output : The triangle is valid.



Sample input  : Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:
                Side 1: 1
                Side 2: 2
                Side 3: 3

Sample output : The triangle is not valid.
===============================================================================================================
Que 6:
=======
What will the program calculate as the bonus for an employee with 7 years of service and a salary of â‚¹50,000?

Employee Bonus
A company provides bonuses based on the employee's years of service:

If service > 10 years, 10% bonus.
If service > 5 years and <= 10 years, 5% bonus.
Otherwise, no bonus.
================================================================================================================
Que 7:
=======
What will the program output for the input 15?
Divisibility Check
A program checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5:

If true, it prints "FizzBuzz."
If divisible by only 3, it prints "Fizz."
If divisible by only 5, it prints "Buzz."
Otherwise, it prints "Not Divisible."
