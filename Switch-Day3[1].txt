Write a C program to take user Id as 1001 and Pasword as 1010. Ask the user to enter his id, if the id is valid 

then ask the user to enter his password ,if the password is correct then print the name of the user, otherwise 

the program will print incorrect Passoword and if the Id doesnot exits, the program will print Incorrect Id.

develop this program by using Switch case. 


int main() {
    int id,pass;
    char name[20];
    printf("enter you id: ");
    scanf("%d",&id);
    
    switch(id){
        case 1231: printf("enter your password: "); scanf("%d",&pass);
        
        switch(pass){

Write a C program that will ask for a person’s name and his/her game score. Then it will ask for a second person’s name and score. 
The program will print the winner’s name and also print by how many 

points that person won by comparing the scores. Develop this program by using switch case.

int main() {
    int score1,score2;
    char name1[20], name2[20];

Using switch statement write a C Program to take the value from the user as input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Computer. 
Calculate percentage and grade according to the following : 
Percentage >= 90% : Grade A
Percentage >= 80% : Grade B
Percentage >= 70% : Grade C
Percentage >= 60% : Grade D
Percentage >= 40% : Grade E
Percentage < 40% : Grade F
Using switch statement.


[Note:-Take All the values as Integer]

1)  Bank Account Operations
Write a C program to simulate a banking system where a user can select the type of account and then perform operations based on their choice.

Requirements:

Account Types:

          1) Savings Account
          2) Current Account

    Operations Based on Account Type:

       For Savings Account:
       1: Check Balance
       2: Deposit
       3: Withdraw

    For Current Account:
     1: Check Balance
     2: Deposit
     3: Withdraw
     4: Overdraft Information


3) Validation:

           Withdrawal cannot exceed the account balance (for both accounts).
          If invalid inputs are provided, display an appropriate error message. 

int main() {
    int n;

Que 5 :
========

Develop below program using switch case

Write a C program that will read a float and a character from console. The character could be 'd' for deposit or 'w' for withdrawal.

Starting with a Minimum balance of 2000.


-> Ask the user to initialize the minimum balance and don't allow 0 and -ve values if it is 0 or -ve then print "Ammount Can't be stored".

-> If the user want deposit operation then ask how much ammount he want to deposit and add that ammount with balance and print the balance.

-> if the user want withdrwal operation then ask how much ammount he want to withdrwal and substract that ammount from the balance and print the balance.



[Note: If the deposit ammount is negetive or 0 print "Invalid ammount". If the withdrawl ammount is negetive , 0 or greater than balance then print "Invalid ammount"]


Hints:
-------

Declare variables for the amount in float, balance in float and transaction code in char types.

Test the transaction code, if ‘d’ it is deposit. Test the ammount so that it is not negative.

If the balance is not negative or positive sum-up the balance.

balance = balance + amount;

Test the transaction code for withdrawal, ‘w’. If the transaction code is ‘w’

Minus the withdrawn amount to update the balance.

balance = balance - amount;

And print the balance.


int main() {
    int n,b,amt;
    b=50000;
    printf("1) Deposit.\n ");
    printf("2) withdraw.\n ");
    
    printf("Enter your choice: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    switch(n){
        case 1: printf(" Deposit\n"); 
                a: 
                printf("Enter your deposite ammount: ");
                scanf("%d",&amt); 
                if(amt<=0) {
                    printf("please enter the valid input.\n");
                    goto a;
                }
                printf("your total balance is %d", b+amt); break;

        case 2: printf(" Withdraw.\n");
                printf("Your balance amount is %d\n",b);
                printf("please withdraw the minnimum amount of 2000.\n");
                printf("enter your withdraw amount: ");
                scanf("%d",&amt);
                if (amt<2000){
                    printf("please enter the amount above 2000.\n");
                }
                else if (amt<=0){
                    printf("Zero or negative number is not allowed.\n");
                }
                else 
                printf("your withdraw amount is: %d\n ",amt);
